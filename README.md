I developed a Job Portal application that allows users to register and log in as either a recruiter or a job seeker. 
Recruiters can post new job openings, manage applications, and review candidate profiles. Job seekers can create and update their profiles, browse job listings, and apply for relevant positions. 
I implemented Spring Security for authentication and role-based access control to ensure data security. 
The application follows the Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for clean and maintainable code. 
I used MySQL as the database to store user and job-related information, and integrated RESTful APIs to handle job postings and applications efficiently. 
The system ensures a seamless experience with proper validation, session management, and access control.






Open to include Spring AI to automatically apply for job matching seeker requirements saving time for users.
